# Mobx state tree sample app with Carbon and Vite

## Usage

Do an `npm install`, then `npm run dev`. This will start the development server on `localhost:3003`. You can change the port in the `package.json`. The first time loading takes a long time because of the Carbon Sass compilation. So will any subsequent change if you change the `.scss` files. Thanks Carbon for making this so horrible. Any other code change is reflected immediately. If not, reload the page.
